-- | Helper functions for testing.
module Test.Hspec.Extra

-- | Run a <tt>bracket</tt> resource acquisition function around all the
--   specs. The bracket opens before the first test case and closes after
--   the last test case.
--   
--   It works by actually spawning a new thread responsible for the
--   resource acquisition, passing the resource along to the parent threads
--   via a shared MVar. Then, there's a bit of logic to synchronize both
--   threads and make sure that:
--   
--   a) The 'Resource Owner' thread is terminated when the main thread is
--   done with the resource.
--   
--   b) The 'Main Thread' only exists when the resource owner has released
--   the resource. Exiting the main thread before the 'Resource Owner' has
--   released the resource could left a hanging resource open. This is
--   particularly annoying when the resource is a running process!
--   
--   Main Thread Resource Owner x | Spawn |-----------------------&gt;x | |

--   |-----------------------&gt;| | | | ... Release resource | Send Done |

-- | Utility function for finding the package test data directory.
module Test.Utils.Paths

-- | A TH function to get the test data directory.
--   
--   It combines the current source file location and cabal file to locate
--   the package directory in such a way that works in both the stack/cabal
--   package build and ghci.
--   
--   For the Nix build, rather than baking in a path that starts with
--   <tt>/build</tt>, it makes the test data path relative to the current
--   directory.

-- | Provides a simple static files web server to be used as a fixture in
--   tests which need a HTTP server.
module Test.Utils.StaticServer

-- | Run a localhost HTTP file server on any free port, while executing the
--   given action.
withStaticServer :: FilePath -> (String -> IO a) -> IO a


-- | Provides utility functions relating to testing with times and dates.
module Test.Utils.Time

-- | A wrapper for <a>UTCTime</a> whose <a>Arbitrary</a> instance spans a
--   uniform range of dates and a mixture of time precisions.
data UniformTime

-- | Generate <a>UTCTime</a> values over a uniform range of dates and a
--   mixture of time precisions.
--   
--   Dates will be generated in a range that's bounded by
--   <a>defaultLowerBound</a> and <a>defaultUpperBound</a>.
genUniformTime :: Gen UTCTime

-- | Generate <a>UTCTime</a> values over a uniform range of dates and a
--   mixture of time precisions.
--   
--   Dates will be generated in a range that's bounded by the given minimum
--   and maximum Julian day arguments.

-- | Provides functions for setting up and capturing logging so that
--   expectations about logging can be asserted in test scenarios.
module Test.Utils.Trace

-- | Run an action with a logging <tt>Trace</tt> object, and a function to
--   get all messages that have been traced.
withLogging :: ((Tracer IO msg, IO [msg]) -> IO a) -> IO a

-- | Run an action with a <tt>Trace</tt>, returning captured log messages
--   along with the result of the action.
