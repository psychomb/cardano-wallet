-- | Remove a SQLite database file.
--
-- If <https://www.sqlite.org/tempfiles.html SQLite temporary files> are present
-- (@-wal@ and @-shm@), we remove them as well. Normally, they would be removed
-- when the SQLite connection is closed. But we attempt to remove them anyway,
-- in case cardano-wallet was unable to close the SQLite connection.
--
-- Additionally, on Windows, the deletion operations will be retried for a short
-- time if they fail.  The reason for this is that a FileDelete command just
-- marks a file for deletion. The file is really only removed when the last
-- handle to the file is closed. Unfortunately there are a lot of system
-- services that can have a file temporarily opened using a shared read-only
-- lock, such as the built in AV and search indexer.
--
-- We can't really guarantee that these are all off, so what we can do is
-- whenever after an rm the file still exists to try again and wait a bit.
--
-- See <https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/96> for more information
-- about this issue.
